Key Questions:

1. Pain or Gain: what section of the brain is involved in decisions that have to do with pain and profit? Use ChatGPT to help out with this.
2. Experimental design: describe how the experiment was setup to test the hypothesis?
3. Machine Learning? What is this? How does it feature in this experiment?

# Tasks: ChatGPT and validation analysis 
1. What is ventral striatum?
2. What are machine learning algorithms? How are they used in medicine?
3. Summarise the article.

## Kavi: Game Development with Phasor.js

1. Phasor Basics: https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-phaser

## Sai: Machine Learning with Python and sci-kit learn library

1. A simple linear regression model using python and sci-kit learn (use ChatGPT to assist where necessary)

- An experimental drug was tested on individuals from ages 13 to 100 in a clinical trial. The trial had 2100 participants. Half were under 65 years old, and the other half were over 65 years old. Around 95% of the participants 65 or older experienced side-effects from the drug and 95% of those under 65 experienced no side-effects at all.

2. Try the same problem with Pytorch?
